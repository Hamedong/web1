  <p>Liverpool is one of the most widely supported clubs in the world, as well as one of the most valuable.
    Liverpool has long-standing rivalries with <strong>Manchester United and Everton</strong>.
    In 1964 the team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip which has been used ever since.
    The club's anthem is <strong><u>"You'll Never Walk Alone"</strong></u>.</p>
  <p>The club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies.
    The Heysel Stadium disaster, where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the 1985 European Cup Final in Brussels,
    resulted in 39 deaths. Most of these were Italians and Juventus fans, and English clubs were given
    a five-year ban from European competition as a result.</p>
  <p>The Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 97 Liverpool supporters died in a crush against perimeter fencing,
     led to the elimination of fenced standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadiums in the top two tiers of English football.</P>
